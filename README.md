# ColumnarCipher
Encryption/Decryption software on how to break the double transposition cipher. 

I developed a tool to run a dictionary attack on the Columnar Cipher. The Columnar Cipher can easily be encrypted or decrypted using a given key. However, what happens when you don't know what the key is? You have to guess the key length, and try all permutations of the key to decrpyt the ciphertext.
